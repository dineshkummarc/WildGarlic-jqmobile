### in jQuery Mobile

This is a simple mobile web application built with [jQueryMobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) and [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/). It is primarily a learning exercise for me, but you might get some value from it too.

My hope is to package this as a [PhoneGap](http://www.phonegap.com/) app and distribute it for multiple platforms.

Please feel free to fork and contribute!
